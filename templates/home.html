  <p>Hey all! My name is Sam and I'm a fresh face to the development community. I recently graduated from Galvanize's Full Stack Web Development program in Denver, CO. My time at Galvanize was the best decision of my life, where I learned cutting edge tech and joined a fantastic community. Before Galvanize, I earned a degree in Marketing and worked for a few years in the non-profit industry. Thanks for visiting my page and getting to know a little bit more about me.</p>
