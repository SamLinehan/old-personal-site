  <p>Hello, my name is Sam and I'm a Full Stack Developer with special interests in JavaScript, AngularJS, and Python. I also love learning new technologies and like to choose the best tools for the job. Recently, I graduated from Galvanize's Full Stack Web Development program in Denver, CO. Prior, I earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Marketing (with honors) from Bentley University in Massachusetts. During my time at Bentley I worked in a variety of jobs in the non-profit industry. I enjoy working on teams, I'm a quick study and highly motivated. Thanks for visiting my homepage and getting to know a little bit about me.</p>
